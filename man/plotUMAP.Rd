\title{Plot UMAP results either on already run results or run first and then plot.}
\usage{
plotUMAP(
  inSCE,
  colorBy = "No Color",

}
\arguments{
\item{inSCE}{Input SCtkExperiment object with saved dimension reduction components
or a variable with saved results. Required}

\item{colorBy}{color by a condition(any column of the annotation data).}

\item{shape}{add shapes to each condition.}

\item{reducedDimName}{saved dimension reduction name in the SCtkExperiment object. Required.}

\item{runUMAP}{If the dimension reduction components are already available
set this to FALSE, otherwise set to TRUE. Default is False.}

\item{useAssay}{Indicate which assay to use. The default is "logcounts"}
}
\value{
a UMAP plot of the reduced dimensions.
